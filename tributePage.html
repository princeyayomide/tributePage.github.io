			<ul id="list">
				<li> <strong>1809</strong> - Born at The Mount, Shrewsbury, the fifth child of Robert Waring Darwin, physician, and Susannah Wedgwood. </li>
				<li><strong>1817</strong> - Darwin's mother dies; his 3 older sisters take on maternal responsibilities.</li>
				<li><strong>1818</strong> - Darwin attends Shrewsbury School as a boarder. He hates the school, describing it as "narrow and classical". </li>
				<li><strong>1825</strong> - Darwin is removed from school, being deemed unsuccessful, and spends the summer accompanying his father on his doctor's rounds. That autumn, he is sent to Edinburgh University, with his brother Erasmus, to study medicine.</li>
				<li><strong>1826</strong> - Darwin joins the Plinian Society in Edinburgh and  meets his most influential mentor at Edinburgh, Robert Grant. </li>
				<li><strong>1827</strong> - Abhorred by medicine, Darwin leaves Edinburgh without taking a degree. Darwin's father, anxious that he does not become idle, insists that Darwin take up clerical studies in Cambridge.</li>
				<li><strong>1828</strong> - After spending some time brushing up on his forgotten Greek, Darwin enters Christ's College, Cambridge.</li>
				<li><strong>1831</strong> - Darwin sits his BA exam, and is astonished to be ranked 10th out of 178 candidates. He finally sets sail on the Beagle. </li>
				<li><strong>1836</strong> - Darwin meets the geologist Lyell for the first time.</li>
				<li><strong>1837</strong> - Darwin reads his first scientific paper "Observations...on the coast of Chile" at the Geological Society in London. </li>
				<li><strong>1838</strong> - Darwin is elected to the Athenaeum..</li>
				<li><strong>1839</strong> - The Beagle journal is published under the title Journals and Remarks, volume three of Darwin's Narrative of the voyage. Darwin marries Emma Wedgwood, his first cousin. Their first child, William Erasmus, is born on December 27th. </li>
				<li><strong>1842</strong> - Darwin writes a thirty-five page sketch of evolutionary theory.</li>
				<li><strong>1844</strong> - Buoyed by Joseph Dalton Hooker’s response to his earlier drafts of evolutionary theory, Darwin finishes a 231 page manuscript.</li>
				<li><strong>1846</strong> - Darwin finishes his last book describing the Beagle voyages: Geological Observations on South America.</li>
				<li><strong>1853</strong> - The Royal Society award Darwin their Royal Medal for his work on barnacles.</li>
				<li><strong>1854</strong> - Darwin is elected to the Royal Society's Philosophical Club, and to the Linnean Society.</li>
				<li><strong>1855</strong> - Darwin conducts experiments to prove that seeds, plants and animals could reach oceanic islands, where they might produce new species in geographic isolation.</li>
				<li><strong>1856</strong> - Darwin invites Huxley and other naturalists to a weekend party, where they discuss his ideas on the origin of species. After the meeting, he begins writing for publication, encouraged by Lyell, who feared that others might publish the same work before him.</li>
				<li><strong>1859</strong> - Darwin now moves quickly. He writes a book, stripped of academic references and aimed at the reading public, called On the Origin of Species. The 1250 print run of 1859 is oversubscribed, and Darwin starts corrections for a second edition.</li>
				<li><strong>1864</strong> - Darwin is awarded the Copley medal of the Royal Society (after being nominated three years running). This is the source of much debate; the Origin of Species was omitted from the award.</li>
				<li><strong>1871</strong> - The Descent of Man is published, and the Origin is extensively re-written to answer arguments by Mivart. This sixth and last edition uses the word 'evolution' for the first time.</li>
				<li><strong>1872</strong> - Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals completes great cycle of evolutionary writings.</li>
				<li><strong>1877</strong> - Cambridge bestows Darwin with an honorary doctorate of law.</li>
				<li><strong>1882</strong> - After a heart attack on Christmas, followed by seizures, Charles Darwin dies, in great suffering, at Down House. He is later buried in Westminster Abbey.</li>
